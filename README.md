# knn_prediction
The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.

## The objectives of the repository:
1. To employ k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm in order to predict attribute
2. To build a model that learn from the attribute/label
3. To check the accuracy of the model, if the accuracy of the model is good, we are good to go to deploy it
